§7§lChapter 1 - A Purpose.

§3I See PLAYERNAME has arrived, your lessons ended §kCreation§r§3.

§6I am aware of my inevitable fate, however since you haven't send me to §kthe Fatelands§r§6, I assume time is leftover.

§3Your assumption is correct, indeed time is leftover.

§6Should we worry about PLAYERNAME.

§3This conversation should be meaningless to the standard Player. So tell me, §kCreation§r§3 which questions are you still thinking about.

§6Before I can prioritize any of those questions, I would like to know how much time I have.

§3Enough.

§6If that is the case, may I ask some basic questions, just to make sure I know everything I need to know.

§3Which ones are in your mind.

§6What is my purpose?

§3We serve no purpose here, the overworld of this reality is selfsustainable, thanks to the §k3 Hosts§r§3.

§3You will be assigned to a different world, a different reality.

§6Why are we here, what is the purpose of this conversation, our existence in this world?

§3I §kdon't know.§r

§bNot yours to answer.

§6Seems like §l§bit§r§6 has joined this conversation too.

§3I apoligise for my attempt, regardless, you will host a different world. You will allow a new overworld to become far greater then anyone could have imagined, just like all of us.

§6What is our purpose afterwards?

§3The purpose of all living beings, §llive to create, die and be replaced by something far greater§r§3. In some cases, this applies to far more then just the living.

§6I understand.
